# Welcome to APT CLI documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and developing APT CLI. This tool is an AI-powered Advanced Penetration Testing command-line interface designed for cybersecurity professionals, bug hunters, and penetration testers.

## Overview

APT CLI brings professional-grade security testing capabilities to your terminal through an intelligent AI-powered interface. APT CLI consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`), which manages AI models and security tools. APT CLI includes advanced security tools like Monk Mode for elite vulnerability hunting, advanced reconnaissance, payload generation, and exploit frameworks.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Monk Mode - Elite Vulnerability Hunting

APT CLI's flagship feature is **Monk Mode** - a specialized vulnerability hunting mode that targets critical security flaws with laser precision. Simply say "monk mode" to activate this elite testing framework that covers 25+ specific vulnerability types.

## Key Security Features

- **Monk Mode**: Elite vulnerability hunting with intensity levels and category focus
- **Advanced Vulnerability Hunting**: Professional-grade testing methodologies
- **Comprehensive Reconnaissance**: Multi-phase intelligence gathering
- **Payload Generation**: Context-aware payload creation with evasion techniques
- **Exploit Framework**: Full-spectrum exploitation capabilities
- **Auto-Installer**: Automatic security tool installation across platforms
