## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @aptx-cli/aptx-cli@latest
aptx --version
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aptx-cli/aptx-cli.git
cd aptx-cli
npm install
npm install -g .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start APTX CLI
aptx

# üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Monk Mode - Elite Vulnerability Hunting
> monk mode
> Go monk mode on https://target.com
> Enter monk mode aggressive https://target.com

# Example commands for vulnerability assessment
> Scan target https://example.com for common vulnerabilities
> Perform reconnaissance on domain example.com
> Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in this web application
> Analyze source code for potential security flaws
```

### üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Monk Mode Usage

Monk Mode is APTX CLI's elite vulnerability hunting feature that targets critical security flaws:

```bash
# Activate Monk Mode (various ways)
> monk mode https://target.com
> Go monk mode
> Enter monk mode aggressive
> monk mode stealth https://api.target.com

# Monk Mode with categories
> monk mode authentication https://login.target.com
> monk mode injection https://app.target.com  
> monk mode owasp-top10 https://webapp.target.com
```

**Intensity Levels:**
- `stealth` - Passive/quiet testing
- `normal` - Standard testing (default)
- `aggressive` - Thorough probing
- `nuclear` - Maximum coverage

### Session Management

Control your token usage with configurable session limits to optimize costs and performance during security assessments.

#### Configure Session Token Limit

Create or edit `.aptx/settings.json` in your home directory:

```json
{
  "sessionTokenLimit": 32000
}
```

#### Session Commands

- **`/compress`** - Compress conversation history to continue within token limits
- **`/clear`** - Clear all conversation history and start fresh
- **`/stats`** - Check current token usage and limits

> üìù **Note**: Session token limit applies to a single conversation, not cumulative API calls.

### Authorization

Choose your preferred authentication method based on your needs:

#### 1. Qwen OAuth (üöÄ Recommended - Start in 30 seconds)

The easiest way to get started - completely free with generous quotas:

```bash
# Just run this command and follow the browser authentication
qwen
```

**What happens:**

1. **Instant Setup**: CLI opens your browser automatically
2. **One-Click Login**: Authenticate with your qwen.ai account
3. **Automatic Management**: Credentials cached locally for future use
4. **No Configuration**: Zero setup required - just start coding!

**Free Tier Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **2,000 requests/day** (no token counting needed)
- ‚úÖ **60 requests/minute** rate limit
- ‚úÖ **Automatic credential refresh**
- ‚úÖ **Zero cost** for individual users
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: Model fallback may occur to maintain service quality

#### 2. OpenAI-Compatible API

Use API keys for OpenAI or other compatible providers:

**Configuration Methods:**

1. **Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your_api_endpoint"
   export OPENAI_MODEL="your_model_choice"
   ```

2. **Project `.env` File**
   Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=your_api_endpoint
   OPENAI_MODEL=your_model_choice
   ```

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the excellent work of multiple open-source projects:

- **[Qwen-Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)** - The immediate foundation for this project, providing AI-powered CLI capabilities
- **[Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** - The original project that inspired the architecture and design patterns

We deeply appreciate the contributions of both teams. APTX CLI represents a specialized fork focused on cybersecurity and penetration testing, building upon their solid foundation while adding security-specific capabilities including our signature "Monk Mode" feature.

### Key Transformations Made:
- Converted from general-purpose code assistant to specialized penetration testing tool
- Added 15+ security tools with auto-installation capabilities
- Implemented Monk Mode for elite vulnerability hunting
- Enhanced with professional security research workflows
- Integrated advanced reconnaissance and payload generation capabilities

This project maintains the open-source spirit while serving the cybersecurity community.
